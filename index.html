Through ecperience we have learn that not everyone has the same ideas when it comes to design so we try to show the customer some of our work and let them pick a few opetions that they like. We always try to find a deadline for the project that is reasonable for our designers but is also done quickly for the homeowner. The goal is to get the prject done quickly, but some projects may take more time depending on hte size of the room(s).
